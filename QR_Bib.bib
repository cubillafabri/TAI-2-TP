QR codes are matrix type two-dimensional codes in which information is expressed by arranging white and black cells on a lattice much like a checkerboard. Barcodes that are widely diffused now express information by thickness of the bar width. While barcodes can only express information in one-dimension, QR code allow 2D expression of information that enables information to be written at high volume and high density. The QR code has diffused as a code that can be used in the next-generation information age, along with the advancement of computers and network. To diffuse the QR code widely, it was declared public domain (a code that can be used freely with no patent claims).},

In scholarly journals, the QR code is used to provide immediate direction to the journal homepage or specific content such as figures or videos. To produce a QR code and print it in the print version or upload to the web is very simple. Using a QR code producing program, an editor can add simple information to a website. After that, a QR code is produced. A QR code is very stable, such that it can be used for a long time without loss of quality. Producing and adding QR codes to a journal costs nothing; therefore, to increase the visibility of their journals, it is time for editors to add QR codes to their journals.},

  abstract = {Since its introduction in 1994, Quick Response (QR) code has become a trademark for a type of matrix barcode. It became one of the methods of transferring information from print media to digital media. Nowadays, QR code can be found in many forms such as printed advertisements, products, packaging, movie posters and on many other printed materials. It is especially convenient for mobile phone users; the information of the product will be transmitted to the mobile phone in just a blink of an eye. As stated in the Scanlife report, the QR code usagehas increased from 18.2 million to 21.8 million users between rst quarters of 2013 to the rst quarter of 2014. This trend was ampliied by the usage of some big brands such as Coca Cola; using the QR code as part of their advertising campaign. Graphic designers are now thinking of the best possibilities of which to include QR code into the advertisement campaign. Graphic designers have the advantage of producing or designing QR code with a good identity that can boost a specific brand, product and service. This paper unveils the semiotic analysis on some of the selected QR Code obtained in various media, which has been altered by graphic designers. All of the QR codes were then categorised, based on the criteria as listed by Denso Wave, the creator of the code. This research will uncover the important elements in designing QR code, for creating better identity for a brand, product and service.},

It is a specification sheet that is attached to the components and travels everywhere with them. As production volume increased, more invoices had to be processed, and more mistakes occurred as data input was done manually on the computer. Therefore, barcodes were introduced to the "kanban" along with the reader to read the codes to achieve automatic input to the computer. It started on the development of the QR code in 1992.

The manufacturers started to conduct finely-tuned production control, and with the increase of information volume handled, about 10 different barcodes had to be read for management control at manufacturing plants. This slowed down the production efficiency, fatigued the workers, and generated many complaints. 
Also, after the collapse of the bubble economy, many companies pursued high quality as a differentiation point of their products. Since they wished to maintain control at the component level, there were increased demands for a code that could be printed on micro-sized components such as IC.

Due to the lack of security and confidentiality, forgery of confidential information can cause a big margin loss to a person. Personal confidential information needs to be securely shared and hidden with the expected recipient and he should be able to verify the information by checking its authenticity. QR codes are being used increasingly to share data for different purposes. In information communication, QR code is important because of its high data capacity. However, most existing QR code systems use insecure data format and encryption is rarely used. A user can use Secure QR Code (SQRC) technology to keep information secured and hidden. In this paper, we propose a novel SQRC system which will allow sharing authentic personal confidential information by means of QR code verification using RSA digital signature algorithm and also allow authorizing the information by means of QR code validation using RSA public key cryptographic algorithm. We implemented the proposed SQRC system and showed that the system is effective for sharing personal confidential information securely.},

Since it uses inexpensive commodity devices, this method is inexpensive to deploy. The limited range of Bluetooth reception is used to advantage. Another important advantage of this method is that it allows the mobile device to determine its location while remaining anonymous, unidentified to the beacons or other nearby devices. In such a deployment, an important design task is the placement of beacons. Signal propagation in indoor environments is complex, affected by factors such as floor-plans and duct-work, varying transmission and reflection properties of building materials and furniture, and interference from other devices. Therefore, the area from which a beacon is visible is very irregular and not well approximated by simple models such as ellipsoids. Our solution permits complex reception characteristics to be accurately modeled and provides a simple method for choosing beacon locations.},

Nowadays smartphones can solve most of the problems very quickly and easily. It has made
the life of every person simple and easier with the different social apps, commercial app,
problem solving app, an app for education and marketing, etc. Followed by the technology
the paper purposed a system that will handle a problem for recording the attendance. The
proposed system is a couple of two applications, one for generating the QR Code by entering
the student details and the second application for taking the attendance and generating the
attendance in CSV or XLS format. The teacher will need to scan the QR code of the particular
student to confirm their attendance. The paper discusses how the system verifies student
identity to eliminate false registrations. The system deals with the management and
evaluation of attendance of all students. The student QR code will be provided to the
professor for taking their attendance. The professor handling the subjects is responsible to
mark the attendance for all students of the group or class. The attendance will be marked as 0
and 1, 0 for absent and 1 for the present in the database of the particular student row in the
table. The student attendance reports will be generated in CSV and XLS sheets for further use.},

Más minoristas están llevando su tienda en línea al mundo fuera de línea utilizando códigos QR. Los códigos QR son un código de barras confiable para teléfonos celulares que puede almacenar la URL del sitio web, el número de teléfono, la dirección de correo electrónico y mucho más. Una tienda virtual muestra productos en algunos materiales impresos, en PDA o pantallas digitales, o en el producto mismo. Dado que el movimiento del uso de códigos QR en las compras aún está en pañales. Android es una tecnología en crecimiento que ha comenzado a satisfacer las necesidades con muchas aplicaciones para hacer las cosas más prácticas. Los códigos QR pueden conectar a los usuarios con la información de forma rápida y sencilla. En este artículo, exploramos cómo se pueden utilizar los códigos QR en las compras. La baja barrera técnica de crear y leer códigos QR permite a los propietarios de tiendas innovadores incorporarlos a sus esfuerzos de compra. Las operaciones para recuperar o almacenar códigos QR son increíblemente simples y rápidas, y con dispositivos móviles. El consumidor de nuestra aplicación puede comprar productos a través del código QR y almacenar ese producto en el carrito.

Design/methodology/approach A quantitative method was implemented in this study. The field study was conducted in 2019 in the two most visited urban destinations in Serbia. The proposed model was examined using partial least squares, and the model fits, composite reliability and convergent validity were assessed. The direction and significance of the relationships were determined by testing all of the hypotheses. Findings The results showed that there was a positive effect of using QR codes. However, the study showed that a QR code cannot completely affect the overall satisfaction at a destination. The analysis of the control variables (age and economic status) showed that individual, demographic and economic factors must be taken into consideration to predict individuals’ behaviour. Research limitations/implications To enable the generalization of the results, it is advised to conduct research on cross-cultural levels. Future studies related to the topic could be conveyed in other forms of tourism, as well as in other industries, which would provide a better insight into the application of this technology in the future. Originality/value The study enables managers of tourism businesses, especially in hospitality, to better understand the importance of the use of a QR code at a destination as an important marketing tool for getting information, and thus to satisfy guests’ expectations.},

Electronic software applications are developed in many different forms in order to serve customers’ needs. In the
advertising medium, smart phone QR code reader applications allow consumers to scan QR codes on magazine
ads. In order to study consumer motivations to use QR codes on magazine ads, we used conclusive research. We
found that consumers are motivated by getting some sort of promotion offered by the business when they scan a
QR code on a magazine ad; they are looking for a useful link where they can get relevant product information
and see customer reviews; and they are motivated by being entertained throughout the experience. We found that
consumers who are more involved with promotional deals are especially important for marketers who choose to
add QR codes to their magazine ads.},

Uno de los primeros usos de los códigos QR en latas provino del gigante de bebidas Coca-Cola. En este caso, el objetivo no era meramente informativo. A partir de 2011, la filial alemana de Coca-Cola buscó conectar a los compradores de sus pequeñas latas rojas de 25 cl con vídeos musicales de actuaciones de bandas de garaje como Mando Diao. Al escanear, los códigos enviaban a los usuarios de smartphones a la web Coke Music Portal, donde podían ver vídeos o descubrir conciertos organizados por la empresa. Fue una buena idea de marketing orientada a jóvenes que funcionó, lo que mostró el potencial de vincular el contenido web con el consumo del mundo real. Eche un vistazo al apartado código QR de vídeos.

Coca-Cola no se detuvo ahí. Desde 2011, han sido protagonistas clave en el esquema de SmartLabel que utiliza los códigos QR para proporcionar información nutricional, lo que se puede realizar con el código QR de PDF. Se trata de llegar a los clientes a través de la tecnología que usan. Como dijo el director general de la empresa para dispositivos móviles en 2016, «tengo que conseguir que, si los consumidores tienen un teléfono móvil en una mano, tengan una Coca-Cola en la otra».},
